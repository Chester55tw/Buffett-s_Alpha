# Buffett-s_Alpha
The investment philosophy of Warren Buffett is the subject of widespread interest and analysis. The paper "Buffettâ€™s Alpha" examines his approach. Buffett's strategy is grounded in value investing, which involves identifying companies that the market undervalues but have strong potential for long-term growth. 

In this project, we aim to emulate Buffett's approach, focusing on stocks that are safe and of high quality. Safety and quality can be gauged through various financial indicators and company performance metrics.

We've chosen to construct our portfolio based on Berkshire Hathaway's own holdings, using the company's 13F-HR filings as our source. These filings are public documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing a detailed list of the stocks that Berkshire Hathaway holds. Websites like Stockzoa aggregate and present this data in a user-friendly format.

Key holdings in Berkshire's portfolio include Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Chevron. These five companies alone constitute nearly 78% of the total portfolio weight. Our objective is to adopt this portfolio composition, adjusting for optimal weight as suggested by the paper, and study whether we can outperform the market, thereby gaining insights into the traits of Buffett's successful strategy.
